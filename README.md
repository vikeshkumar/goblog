A Blogging Application build with Golang
---

Yes, the only goal of this is to have a working Application - as simple and dumb but functional as it can be.

There are two parts of this app
1. One that a reader will see - this application contains everything for the reader.
2. One that an admin will use - it's a SPA, written in Angular (surprise, it's not React).

Configurations
---
All the configurations are provided in config.toml file. Even in this day and age, need to update the config.toml file separately for production and no production use.

TODO
---
- Test Coverage : Its simply not there.
- FAQ
- Establish CI/CD pipeline
